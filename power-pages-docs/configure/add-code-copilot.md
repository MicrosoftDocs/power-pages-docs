# Add AI-generated code using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Add AI-generated code using Copilot in Visual Studio Code to help you create code using natural language chat interaction. You can also delve deeper into existing code and learn what it means by using the Explain feature. In Power Pages, you work with site code that includes HTML, JS, or CSS code to make site customizations that aren't currently supported in the Power Pages low-code design studio. This Copilot chat experience assists Power Pages developers like you to write code by describing your expected code behavior using natural language. You can then refine the generated code and use it when customizing your site.

## Prerequisites

Review the [terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520) and [Responsible AI FAQ](../responsible-ai-overview.md) documents to understand usage and limitations of Copilot. Check the following requirements to start using Copilot in Power Pages. 

### Visual Studio Code
- Ensure you have installed the latest Power Platform Tools extension. 
- Open the site root folder in Visual Studio Code.

- Sign in to Power Pages Copilot with your Dataverse Environment credentials.

### Visual Studio Code for the Web

You can also use Copilot in Power Pages while editing code using [Visual Studio Code for the Web](visual-studio-code-editor.md).

## How to use Copilot to generate code

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Copilot in Visual Studio Code is tuned to generate code for Power Pages sites, so its **functionalities are limited to Power Pages site-supported languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS**. The generated code from Copilot makes use of supported frameworks like bootstrap and jQuery. 

1. In the Copilot chat, describe the code behavior you want using natural language. For example, code for form validation or Ajax calls using the Power Pages Web API. 
1. Continue to rephrase your questions in the Copilot chat and iterate them until you‚Äôve got what you need.  
1. Once you're happy with the generated code, you can easily copy and paste the code snippet or insert the code to the Power Pages site and modify the code further.
1. Use the **up/down** arrow key to navigate between recently entered prompts.  

Examples:
- `Write code for Web API to fetch active contacts`
- `Write code in JavaScript to make sure that submitted value for phone number field is in valid format`

> [!NOTE]
> - Copilot-generated code might not have the correct names for tables or columns, so it‚Äôs recommended to verify these details before using the code. 
> - To generate more **accurate** code, make sure you open the file where you want to use the code. For example, open a **web template** where you want to add Web API code or open a custom JavaScript file for forms where you want to add field validation.

## How to use Explain in Copilot to understand code
Copilot's Explain feature is useful for developers who are working on existing code and want to understand it. To use Explain, follow these steps:

Select the lines of code you want to understand from the code editor, right-click to access the in-context menu and then select **Copilot in Power Pages > Explain**. Copilot will record the selected lines of code in the chat panel and provide a response explaining the code to you.

Alternatively, select the lines of code and type `Explain selected code` in the Copilot chat panel. You can also directly ask Copilot by adding the code in the prompt. For example, you can ask `Explain the following code {% include 'Page Copy'%}`.

## Known issues

In some instances, a prompt is classified incorrectly as malicious code.

## Help us improve this feature
In every response of the Copilot chat, select the feedback options, a thumb up (üëç) if you like the response or thumb down (üëé) if you didn‚Äôt like it. Your feedback greatly helps improve the capabilities of this feature.
