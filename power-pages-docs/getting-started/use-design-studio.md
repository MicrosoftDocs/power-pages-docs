# Use design studio

The Power Pages design studio is an intuitive interface that enables low-code makers to build and configure rich business web apps.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the design studio, you will need to be assigned the [system administrator role](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles) in the same Microsoft Dataverse environment as your site. 

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

    The first time you visit the site, select the **Try it for free** button to [sign up for a free, 30-day trial](trial-signup.md).

1. Choose your site, then select **Edit** to launch the design studio.

    If you don't have a site created yet, select **Create a site** to [create your website](create-manage.md)

The design studio has four marquee experiences—called *workspaces*—that focus on specific user jobs. Learn more about [design studio's workspaces](../configure/design-build-overview.md). 

## Page editing options

While designing and building your page, you can **zoom in (+)**, **zoom out (-)**, or **Reset** the zoom to the default size of the page in the design studio, or switch to [code editor](code-editor.md).

## Preview your site

When you're done building, preview your site on desktop or mobile with the **Preview** option. Select **Desktop** to open the site in a new web browser tab. Scan the QR code to preview the site with your mobile device. You can also email a preview link for mobile site viewing.

## Accessing the Portal Management app and sync

For advanced configurations that aren't available in the Power Pages design studio, the [Portal Management app](../configure/portal-management-app.md) is accessible from the overflow menu. Select the **ellipsis icon** from the left-hand menu to view more items, then select **Portal management**.

To reflect changes made to the site from the Portal Management app to the Power Pages design studio, select **Sync** in the upper-right corner of the design studio.
