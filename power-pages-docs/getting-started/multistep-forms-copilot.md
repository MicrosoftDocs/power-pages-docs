# Add an AI-generated multistep form using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

An easy way to add a multistep form to your Power Pages website is to ask Copilot to create one for you. In the copilot sidecar chat, describe the form you need. Copilot builds a multistep form with one or multiple steps based on your description and generates a preview. Review the form and its steps before adding it to your page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE [preview-tags](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - This feature doesn't support non-English language input.
> - This feature will be available for preview in the United States only.
> - To understand capabilities and limitations of AI-powered and Copilot features in Power Pages design studio, see [FAQ for creating AI-generated form or multistep form](../faqs-create-form.md).

## **Prerequisites**

To use AI-powered Copilot features in Power Pages:

- Your environment must be located in the United States.
- Your browser language must be set to US-English.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot in design studio is currently experiencing issues generating multistep forms. Instead, you can [create a multistep form using studio controls](tutorial-add-multi-step-form.md) or [use Copilot to generate a basic form](add-form-copilot.md).

## Create a multistep form

To use Copilot to generate a multistep form:

1. Go to the [Pages workspace](first-page.md) and choose a page for your form.

1. Select the **Copilot** button from the command bar.

1. Type a description of your form in the copilot text box. For example, you might ask Copilot to create a credit card application form.

    :::image type="content" source="media/multistep-form-copilot/multistep-form-copilot.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Power Pages' Copilot inside the design studio with the prompt text box emphasized.":::

    After the form is generated, a preview of the form displays on the canvas, and the **Review this form** toolbar displays at the bottom of the canvas.

    :::image type="content" source="media/multistep-form-copilot/copilot-review-form.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the AI-generated form in the design studio with review toolbar emphasized.":::

    Review each step. Then decide if you want to keep the form or discard it. If you choose to add the form to the page, you can edit it using design studio's existing functionality just as you would for other components.
