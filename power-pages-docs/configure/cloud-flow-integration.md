# Configure Power Automate cloud flows in Power Pages

Power Automate cloud flow allows users to create automated workflows between different applications and services. You can use a Power Automate cloud flow to create logic that performs one or more tasks when an event occurs. For example, configure a button so that when a user selects it, send an email or meeting request, update a record, collect data, synchronize files, and other tasks.

Now, you can securely invoke Power Automate cloud flows from Power Pages to interact with 1000+ external data sources and integrate it into your business site.

> [!NOTE]
> - Your Power Pages site version must be 9.5.4.xx or later for this feature to work.
> - Your starter site package version must be 9.3.2304.x or higher.

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Power Pages, a Power Automate license is required. It's recommended to use a [Power Automate Process](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types?tabs=power-automate-premium%2Cpower-automate-process%2Cconnector-types#power-automate-process) license in the production instance.

## Steps to integrate cloud flow

1. Create a cloud flow.

1. Add the flow to your site.

1. Invoke a flow from your website.

## Create a flow

1. Sign into [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

1. Select site **+ Edit**.

1. Navigate to the **Set up** workspace, then select **Cloud flows** under **App integrations**.

1. Select **+ Create new flow**.

1. Search for **Power Pages** Select **When Power Pages calls a flow** trigger.

1. Define your flow steps and return values and select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only [solution-aware](/power-automate/overview-solution-flows) flows can be attached to the Power Pages site.

## Add a flow to your Site

After you create an instant cloud flow, it needs to be associated with the Power Pages site and secured with a web role.

1. Sign into [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

1. Select site **+ Edit**.

1. Navigate to the **Set up** workspace, then select **Cloud flows (preview)** under **App integrations**.

1. Select **+ Add cloud flow**.

1. Search for the recently created flow.

1. Select **+ Add roles** under **Roles**.

1. Select roles that should have access to the flow.

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add a flow to your site, a unique URL is generated that allows you to invoke the cloud from your site.

## Invoke a flow from web page

Use Power Pages cloud flow API to interact with Power Automate to perform external service integration. Cloud flow API operations consist of HTTP requests and responses.

| Operation         | Method | URI                                                    |
|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Invoke cloud flow | POST   | \[Site URI\]\_/api/cloudflow/v1.0/trigger/&lt;guid&gt; |

Example:

Request

```html
POST https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/_api/cloudflow/v1.0/trigger/4d22a1a2-8a67-e681-9985-3f36acfb8ed4
{
    "eventData": "{\"Location\":\"Seattle\"}"
}
``` 

Response

Cloud flow without response action

```html
HTTP/1.1 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
```

Cloud flow with response action

```html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Body
{
    "conditions":"Rain",
    "humidity":"93",
    "latitude":"47.60620880126953",
    "longitude":"-122.33206939697266"
}
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Output parameters are returned with lowercase names, no matter what casing was used in the cloud flow.

## Authenticating cloud flow API requests

You don't need to include an authentication code, because the application session manages authentication and authorization. All API calls must include a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token.

## Passing parameter to cloud flow

In a cloud flow, you can define input parameters of type **Text**, **Boolean**, **File**, and **Number**. The parameter name you define in the request body should match the parameter name defined in the cloud flow trigger. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - You must pass the request parameters name as defined in the cloud flow.
> - Support for passing a parameter to a flow configured with secure inputs is not available.

### Sample JavaScript to call a flow

This sample demonstrates how to call a flow using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX).
 
```
    shell.ajaxSafePost({
        type: "POST",
        url: "/_api/cloudflow/v1.0/trigger/44a4b2f2-0d1a-4820-bf93-9376278d49c4",
        contentType: "application/json",
        data: JSON.stringify({"eventData":JSON.stringify({"Email": "abc@contoso.com", "File":{"name":"Report.pdf", "contentBytes":"base 64 encoded string"} })})
    })
    .done(function (response) {
    
    })
    .fail(function(){
    
    });
```
> [!NOTE] 
> - If no input parameter is defined in the trigger, pass a payload with empty eventData in the request (`data: JSON.stringify({"eventData":JSON.stringify({})})`).
> - For information on cloud flow limitations, see [Limits of automated, scheduled, and instant flows](/power-automate/limits-and-config).
