## Proxies
Power Pages doesn't support running with a proxy enabled. This can cause unpredictable behavior. If you encounter issues, disable the proxy, and then try again.

- Some proxies (such as Zscaler, Blue Coat) modify Power Pages requests by removing headers (CORS or authentication headers). Power Pages relies on these headers to load the app.

## Data types size limits

For Microsoft Dataverse data type size limits, you can find information on column types, such as text and image columns, in [Types of columns](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/types-of-fields).
