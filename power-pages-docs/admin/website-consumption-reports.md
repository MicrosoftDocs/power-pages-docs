# Website capacity consumption reports

Power Pages is licensed by using **authenticated user monthly capacity** and **anonymous user monthly capacity** add-ons for external users. This capacity must be allocated to a Microsoft Power Platform environment by an administrator. More information: [Licensing FAQ](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq?branch=main#power-pages)

Administrators can download **Power Pages authenticated** and **Power Pages anonymous** view reports (as well as legacy **Portal logins** and **Portal page views** reports) from the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.com). These reports show the number of authenticated sign-ins and anonymous user site accesses for Power Pages websites across all environments for a tenant. 

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators should use the license dashboard to monitor capacity consumption for **Power Pages authenticated** and **Power Pages anonymous**. For more information: [Capacity management overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/admin/capacity-management).
