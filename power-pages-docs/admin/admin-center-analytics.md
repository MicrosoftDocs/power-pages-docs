# Monitor traffic to your websites (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Use the Power Platform admin center to monitor the traffic to the websites in your tenant. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE [preview-tags](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - This feature is gradually being rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

### Access the analytics dashboard

To access the analytics dashboard, you should have one of the following roles:

- Global Administrator
- Dynamics 365 administrator
- Power Platform administrator
- System administrator (you can only see environments for which you're a system administrator)

## View traffic analytics for all websites in a tenant

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. On the left pane, select **Resources**, then select **Power Pages sites**.
1. Go to **Analytics**.

From here you can view the traffic that your websites are receiving: Daily Active Users (DAU), Weekly Active Users (WAU), and Monthly Active Users (MAU).

All charts show the DAU, WAU, and MAU across all the sites in the selected environment. You can select the environment of your interest using the dropdown.

Within the selected environment, you can also select a specific site for which you want to see the traffic. Select the Site ID from the dropdown (You can select multiple sites by using ctrl + click) to see traffic for that site.

>[!NOTE]
> Currently, only Site ID is supported for filtering. The Site ID can be found under the **Your Sites** tab.
> Traffic reports are available only for public sites. Private sites are not included in these reports. More information: [Difference between a private site and a public site](../security/site-visibility.md#difference-between-a-private-site-and-a-public-site)

### Considerations

- The charts show DAU, WAU, and MAU numbers for the following categories of users:
    - Authenticated Users show the unique authenticated users who accessed the websites.
    - Anonymous Users show the unique anonymous users who accessed the websites.
    - All Users show the unique users who accessed the websites (either by authentication or anonymously).
- All the traffic numbers (DAU, WAU, and MAU) shown are with the intent of understanding the visits to the websites. 
- The authenticated user counts may vary slightly from license consumption reports. For instance, in cases where the authenticated user already has a Power Apps license, the visit isn't counted in license consumption but is counted in the total authenticated users visiting the website.
- The usage numbers can be underreported for the first few days after enabling the feature. For instance, the monthly active users will be accurate after 30 days of this feature being live, and weekly active users will be accurate after seven days of this feature being live.
