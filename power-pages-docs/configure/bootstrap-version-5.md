# Enable Bootstrap version 5 in your environment 

[Bootstrap version 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) offers new features, like CSS Flexbox and responsive layout, that make creating more responsive, customized Power Pages sites even easier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Bootstrap version 5 is only supported with the [enhanced data model](../admin/enhanced-data-model.md).

Power Platform environments and Power Pages sites use Bootstrap version 3 by default. To start creating sites with Bootstrap version 5 or migrate your existing sites, enable Bootstrap version 5 in your environment. Once the setting is enabled, all new sites created in the environment will use Boostrap version 5.

## Set up Bootstrap version 5

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

1. In the left side panel, select **Environments**, and then select your environment.

1. On the **Resources** tile, select **Power Pages sites**.

1. Turn on both **Switch to enhanced data model (preview)**.

1. Confirm when you're prompted to enable Bootstrap version 5 for new sites.

View and edit Power Pages sites that you create with Bootstrap version 5 the same way you did with version 3. Learn how to [edit your site](../getting-started/customize-pages.md) and [customize your site](../configure/bootstrap-overview.md#customize-bootstrap).

## Supported templates

Create your sites with Power Pages templates that support Bootstrap version 5:

- [Blank page template](../templates/blank.md)
- [Starter layout templates](../templates/starter-layout.md)
- [Application processing template](../templates/building-permit.md)
- [Program registration template](../templates/after-school.md)
- [Schedule and manage meetings template](../templates/book-a-meeting.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions template (preview)](../templates/frequently-asked-questions.md)
