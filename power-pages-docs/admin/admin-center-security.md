## Anonymous access enabled

**Anonymous access enabled** shows the number of websites where anonymous access is allowed for certain tables in Microsoft Dataverse. It means that these sites have at least one table permission that allows anonymous users to have access to the data. More information: [Table permissions](../security/assign-table-permissions.md)

Select **View details** to see the review the anonymous access setting for each website.

**Web Application Firewall disabled** shows the number of production websites where [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](../security/web-application-firewall.md) is disabled.

Enabling WAF improves the security of your website and Microsoft recommends enabling WAF. More information: [Enable Web Application Firewall for a website](../security/configure-web-application-firewall.md)

Select **View details** to see the review the external authentication configuration for each website.

### Site security health

**Site security health** dashboard gives you a summary of the websites in your organization related security status. The security status of a website is determined based on certain security checks that are run for each website. More information: [Security site checker](../security/site-checker-security.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The security health is calculated by looking at various configuration parameters and identifying common issues. These checks are not exhaustive and we recommend you to continue following security best practices.

The criteria for classifying security health into Standard, Enhanced and Advanced is shown below. This criteria might change during the feature preview and before the feature is generally available.

| Health status | Description |
| - | - |
| Standard | This status means that less than 33% of the security checks for this website are in **Pass** state. |
| Enhanced | This status means that more than 33% of the security checks for this website are in **Pass** state. |
| Advanced | This status means that more than 66% of the security checks for this website are in **Pass** state. |
| No results | This status means that security checker hasn't been run or if the site configurations don't allow checks to be run. Examples: A site that has an IP restriction setup, or a site that is stopped. To resolve this, please run the site checker from Power Platform Admin Center. In case webiste has IP address restrictions, running site checker will not work |

Select **View** to find out the security checker results.

> [!NOTE]
> The checks are flagged as **Warning** when the configurations are not the same as what Microsoft recommends. There can be cases where your business needs demand the sites to be configured in a way that is not the **Recommended** state.

## Authentication providers

**Authentication providers** shows the list of all authentication providers that are used across the websites in your tenant, along with the count of all websites in which they're used
