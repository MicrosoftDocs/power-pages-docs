# Create AI-generated color theme using Copilot

Copilot for theme allows you to create a theme for your brand from the design studio. After generating the theme using Copilot, you can customize the theme further in the [Styling workspace](style-site.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To understand the capabilities and limitations of this feature, see [FAQ for Copilot for design studio](../faqs-design-studio.md).

To use Copilot for theme:

1. Go to the [Pages workspace](first-page.md).

1. Select the **Copilot** icon.

1. Within the Copilot sidecar, select **Page design** -> **Create a color theme**.
1. Describe the theme that you want to generate using AI. Choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field. For example, "Create a color theme for Microsoft."

    If you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

1. Press the Enter key or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box to send Copilot your request.

To customize the theme, you can choose the following options:

- **Try again**: Generates new theme based on the already provided description.

- **Styling workspace**: The AI theme can be customized in the [styling workspace](style-site.md) manually just like any other theme.

To avoid unintentionally publishing changes to your site, review, edit, and verify the generated theme to make sure it fits your requirements.
