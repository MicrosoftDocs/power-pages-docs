# Assign licensing

A free trial is available for Power Pages, which can be used to try out the new features and functionality. More information: [Power Pages trial](../getting-started/trial-signup.md)

As you work on projects and need to establish permanent sites that don't expire, you can apply Power Pages subscriptions and convert websites from **trial** to **production**. For detailed information, go to [Convert a portal](/power-apps/maker/portals/admin/convert-portal).

For detailed information on licensing, go to [Power Pages licensing](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#power-pages) in the Power Platform admin documentation.
