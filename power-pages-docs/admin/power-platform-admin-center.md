# Manage websites from the Power Platform admin center

You can now use the Power Platform admin center to manage websites in your tenant. You can also see information such as how many days are left before a trial website expires. For more information about Power Pages licensing, go to the [licensing FAQ](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#power-pages). For more information about the Power Platform admin center, go to [Administer Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation).

You can manage websites in the Power Platform admin center in two ways:

- Manage all websites for the current tenant from **Resources** > **Power Pages sites**.
- Manage websites for a specific environment from **Environments**.
