# Migrate existing sites to Bootstrap version 5

[Bootstrap version 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) offers new features and updates that make your Power Pages sites more responsive and easier to customize.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - You can migrate any of your Bootstrap version 3 sites to version 5 regardless of the template that was used to create them.
> - When you migrate existing Bootstrap version 3 sites to version 5, you can use either the standard data model or the [enhanced data model](../admin/enhanced-data-model.md).
> - Consider testing the migration with a [developer site](../getting-started/developer-sites.md).
> - To check the current version of Bootstrap, see the *bootstrap.min.css* [web file](web-files.md) for your website.

To migrate your Bootstrap version 3 site, follow these steps:

1. [Download the website folder](#download-the-website-folder).
1. [Run the migration tool on the folder](#run-the-migration-tool-on-the-folder).
1. [Review your changes](#review-your-changes).
1. [Upload the migrated website record](#upload-the-migrated-website-record).
1. [Clear the server-side cache](#clear-the-server-side-cache).

Since the migration steps require the use of the Microsoft Power Platform CLI, be sure you understand how to use it in Power Pages:

- [Microsoft Power Platform CLI support for Power Pages](power-platform-cli.md)
- [Tutorial: Use Microsoft Power Platform CLI with Power Pages](power-platform-cli-tutorial.md)
- [`pac pages`](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/pages)

## Prerequisites

- Install [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction#install-using-power-platform-tools-for-visual-studio-code) version 1.28.2 or later.

- If your site uses SVG files, make sure that the [**Set blocked file extensions for attachments**](/power-platform/admin/system-settings-dialog-box-general-tab) system setting in your Power Platform environment allows the ".svg" extension.

- Consider creating two versions of your Power Pages site using Bootstrap version 3. Migrate one of them and use the other as a reference to [compare with the migrated site](#review-your-changes).

## Download the website folder

Starting with Microsoft Power Platform CLI version 1.27, the `pac paportal` command changed to `pac pages`. `paportal` still works, but we recommend that you use `powerpages` going forward. That's the form we use in the following instructions. If you're using Microsoft Power Platform CLI version 1.26.6, make sure that you use `pac paportal` instead of `pac pages`.

1. Open a command prompt.

1. Enter the following command to authenticate to the Dataverse organization for your Power Platform environment: `pac auth create -u [Dataverse URL]`

    **Example:** `pac auth create -u https://contoso-org.crm.dynamics.com`

    More information: [`pac auth create`](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/auth)

1. Enter the following command to generate a list of websites in the organization: `pac pages list`

    Note the **WebSiteId** of the site you plan to migrate.

    More information: [`pac pages list`](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/pages#pac-pages-list)

1. Enter the following command to download the website folder: `pac pages download --path [PATH] -id [WebSiteId-GUID]`

    **Example**: `pac pages download --path "c:\pac-powerpages\downloads" -id d44574f9-acc3-4ccc-8d8d-85cf5b7ad141`

    For the **id** parameter, use the **WebSiteId** that you noted in the previous step.

    More information: [`pac pages download`](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/pages#pac-pages-download)

## Run the migration tool on the folder

Enter the following command to run the migration tool on the website folder that you downloaded: `pac pages bootstrap-migrate -p "WebsiteFolderPath"`

**Example**: `pac pages bootstrap-migrate -p "c:\pac-powerpages\downloads\bootstrap-dev-site"`

The command creates a folder with "V5" appended to the folder name.

If you run into issues while upgrading to Bootstrap version 5 or want to revert to Bootstrap version 3, see [How to revert from Bootstrap version 5 to version 3](#how-to-revert-from-bootstrap-version-5-to-version-3).

Note: Make sure the folder and file names in the path aren't so long that they exceed the 256 character limit for Windows. Otherwise, the migration will terminate prematurely

## Review your changes

If you created a copy of your site before you migrated it, compare it with the version 5 site.

1. Open the **V5** folder you created in the previous step.

1. Open an HTML or CSS file.

1. In Visual Studio Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open a command prompt. Enter `bootstrap diff`.

1. The version 3 file and the version 5 file open. Hover over each highlighted change to review it.

## Upload the migrated website record

Enter the following command to upload the migrated website record to the organization: `pac pages upload --path [Folder-location]`

**Example**: `pac pages upload --path C:\pac-portals\downloads\custom-portal\`

More information: [`pac pages upload`](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/pages#pac-pages-upload)

After you upload the record, the migrated site is a Bootstrap version 5 website. We recommend that you [compare the site with your version 3 site](#review-your-changes) one more time, and modify the Bootstrap version 5 site as needed.

## Clear the server-side cache

[Clear the server-side cache for the metadata/configuration and data tables](../admin/clear-server-side-cache.md).

## How to revert from Bootstrap version 5 to version 3

To revert to Bootstrap version 3:

1. Run the [upload command](migrate-bootstrap.md) to replace the version 5 folder with a Bootstrap version 3 folder. Learn more in [pac pages bootstrap-migrate](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/pages#pac-pages-bootstrap-migrate).
1. Open the [Portal Management app](portal-management-app.md) and delete the **Site/BootstrapV5Enabled** site setting. Learn more in [Configure site settings for websites](configure-site-settings.md).
1. Clear the server-side cache. Learn more in [How server-side caching works in Power Pages](../admin/clear-server-side-cache.md).
