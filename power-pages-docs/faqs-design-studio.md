## What is Copilot for design studio’s intended use?

The intended use case for Copilot for Design Studio is to aid users in creating and customizing web pages, especially when starting or prototyping a new Power Pages site.

The system also allows makers to enhance their existing pages by updating the theme, styles, and content.

## How was Copilot for design studio evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We conducted extensive testing before the feature release. Copilot for design studio relies on user feedback to report if the AI-generated text content isn't relevant or inappropriate. If you receive irrelevant or inappropriate responses, report it to Microsoft using the thumbs down gesture and include feedback in the form. We track the telemetry of thumbs up and thumbs down gestures present in the Copilot experiences for each AI-generated output. Your feedback helps improve the functionality moving forward.

## What are the limitations of Copilot for design studio? How can users minimize the impact of Copilot for design studio’s limitations when using the system?

- This feature doesn’t support non-English language input.
- This feature is available for preview only in the United States region.
- There's a limit on the number of tokens allowed in a query and response, so you may see corresponding limits on the number words that you can use in your prompt description, which may vary based on your use case.

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of Copilot for design studio?

Copilot for design studio is available when sites are in private mode so that users don't automatically publish AI generated content on their public sites. When Copilot generates a new page or updates an existing page, you can review the suggested updates and use options like undo to reject that change. Other options such suggested prompts, regenerate, or revising your prompt are options available for more attempts if the generated content isn't correct or appropriate for your requirements.
